# Goodreads Books Data Analysis

This project explores a dataset of popular and trending books from Goodreads. The analysis focuses on understanding author productivity, publishing trends, book score distributions, reader engagement patterns (ratings and shelvings), and whether newer books are rated differently than older ones.

## What‚Äôs Included:
- Top authors and publishing year trends
- Score, ratings, and shelvings distribution
- Correlation analysis between popularity and quality
- Time-based trends in reader engagement
- Statistical testing of book scores before and after the year 2000

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Goodreads dataset from Kaggle

## üìÇ Dataset Source:
[Kaggle ‚Äì Goodreads Popular and Trending Books Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/goodreads-books)

## Conclusion:
The project concludes that while newer books are more frequently shelved and rated, overall book quality (as measured by score) has remained stable across decades. Popularity is not strongly linked to score, and statistical analysis confirms subtle but significant trends in book perception over time.
